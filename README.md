## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze how significant events such as political decisions, conflicts in oil-producing regions, global economic sanctions, and changes in OPEC policiesâ€”impact the price of Brent oil. This project will:

1. **Identify Key Events**: Pinpoint the major events over the past decade that have significantly influenced Brent oil prices.
  
2. **Measure Impact**: Assess the degree to which these events contribute to price fluctuations.

3. **Provide Actionable Insights**: Deliver clear, actionable insights that will assist investors, policymakers, and energy companies in understanding and responding to these price changes effectively.

By tackling this issue, Birhan Energies aims to empower its clients to make informed decisions, manage risks more efficiently, and optimize strategies for investment, policy development, and operational planning within the energy sector.
